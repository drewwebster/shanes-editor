Shane's Editor makes it possible to create content in VR using web technologies.
It supports many 3d shapes, a rich set of optimised prefab models built in and supports javascript scripting.

The editor interface uses `aframe-material-collection` for all UI components and interaction.

I will update this documentation much more in the coming days!
